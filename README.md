# Libraries and technologies used

-Navigation component : one activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activites.

-Retrofit : making HTTP connection with the rest API and convert meal json file to Kotlin/Java object.

-Room : Save meals in local database.

-MVVM & LiveData : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.

-Coroutines : do some code in the background.

-view binding : instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.

-Glide : Catch images and load them in imageView.
